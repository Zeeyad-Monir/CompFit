# Onboarding Tutorial Implementation

## Overview
The onboarding system has been updated to ensure ALL users (both existing and new) see the tutorial exactly once.

## Key Changes

### 1. Simplified Storage Key
- Changed from versioned keys to a single key: `onboarding_completed_v1`
- The "v1" suffix ensures existing users will see the onboarding once
- Future versions can use "v2", "v3" etc. to re-trigger for updates

### 2. Moved Trigger Location
- **OLD**: Onboarding check was in `HomeStack` component
- **NEW**: Onboarding check is now in `AppNavigator` component
- This ensures it runs immediately when any authenticated user enters the app

### 3. Improved Completion Logic
- Both "Skip" and "Complete" actions mark onboarding as done
- Added duplicate start prevention
- Added console logging for debugging

## How It Works

1. **First Launch Detection**
   - When `AppNavigator` mounts (user is authenticated)
   - Checks AsyncStorage for `onboarding_completed_v1` key
   - If not found, starts onboarding after 1 second delay

2. **Persistence**
   - Once completed or skipped, saves to AsyncStorage
   - Survives app restarts and updates
   - Tied to device, not user account

3. **For All Users**
   - New users: See it on first login
   - Existing users: See it once after this update
   - All users: Never see it again after completion

## Testing

### Reset Onboarding (Development)
```javascript
// Option 1: Use testOnboarding.js
import resetOnboarding from './testOnboarding';
await resetOnboarding();

// Option 2: Manual reset in console
await AsyncStorage.removeItem('onboarding_completed_v1');

// Option 3: Triple-tap version number in ProfileScreen
// (if OnboardingResetHelper is integrated)
```

### Verify Onboarding Status
```javascript
const completed = await AsyncStorage.getItem('onboarding_completed_v1');
console.log('Onboarding completed:', completed === 'true');
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/services/onboardingService.js**
   - Simplified to single key system
   - Removed version checking

2. **src/navigation/AppNavigator.js**
   - Added onboarding check to main component
   - Removed from HomeStack

3. **src/components/onboarding/OnboardingController.js**
   - Improved logging
   - Skip now marks as complete
   - Prevents duplicate starts

4. **testOnboarding.js**
   - Updated to clear new key
   - Also cleans up old keys

5. **NEW: src/components/onboarding/OnboardingResetHelper.js**
   - Developer helper for testing
   - Triple-tap to reset onboarding

## Console Logs

You'll see these logs to track onboarding status:
- `"Starting onboarding for user"` - When tutorial begins
- `"User has already completed onboarding"` - When already done
- `"Onboarding already active, skipping start"` - Duplicate prevention
- `"User completed onboarding"` - When finished all steps
- `"User skipped onboarding"` - When skipped
- `"Onboarding marked as completed"` - When saved to storage

## Future Updates

To show onboarding again for major updates:
1. Change key to `onboarding_completed_v2`
2. Optionally check for specific features
3. Can show abbreviated version for updates
